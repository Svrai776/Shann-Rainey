# FEWD Week #6 Project: Working with Arrays

---


### Description


The team from CitiPix has reached out for iteration on their prototype.  Instead of using a user's text input to change the background of the interface, the CitiPix user experience designers have asked to see how a drop-down menu would work in place of an input field.  The product managers are hopeful it will also lead to less error handling for their engineers and data team.  Use what you've learned this week about data-types and arrays and use the starter code - or your code from last week - and make the adjustments to your JavaScript file. Be sure to start out with Pseudocode.
