# FEWD Week #8 Project: Forms

---


### Description


This week, you'll be practicing your form skills: you have the option of adding a form to your final project, finishing the Relaxr form that will be started in class, or building a form for CitiPix. The form you build must include at least three different types of HTML form elements and some light CSS styling. We have given you an example of a form that renders well on the web and mobile devices, as well as an example, with starter code, of a registration form you could build for Relaxr.
