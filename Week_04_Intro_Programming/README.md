### Week 4 Intro To Programming

This week we are setting the stage for you to create interactive apps. You will continue to add to your understanding in the following 3 weeks.

The main project and homework this week is to create interactivity on Relaxr's blog by hiding and showing content on click events. See the assignment [here](Assignment).  

Next week, your will also be required to hand in wireframes for your final projects. You can create wireframes using tools like [Balsamiq Mockups](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/), [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) or just plain old pen and paper.
